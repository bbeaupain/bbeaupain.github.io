### Senior Software Engineer - Nacelle (2022 - Present)

* Designed and implemented a net-new set of services using Go and gRPC  to track and publish system events across a highly decoupled  stack of microservices.
* Worked directly with C-level executives to help design, plan, and execute a major overhaul to a core customer-facing data ingestion system built with TypeScript, Kafka, and RESTful APIs.
* Built a replacement for a core piece of data ingestion infrastructure, reducing lines of code from 50,000 to less than 1,000 and improving performance by nearly 10x.

### Open Source (2010 - Present)

* Created a low-level library that makes Linux io_uring functionality available  to Java using JNI and C, allowing for extremely high performance networked applications.
* Built a small but functional web server library that utilizes the aforementioned io_uring project to achieve impressive HTTP benchmarks in Java, outperforming all other Java libraries tested.
* Maintainer of khttp, a simple http library for Kotlin with nearly 500 stars on GitHub.
* Built and released Votifier, an open-source project for Minecraft servers with over 100 forks on Github and 500,000 downloads.

### Architecture & Development Consultant - Slalom LLC (2017 - 2022)

* Worked across multiple teams to build services in AWS Lambda and Java  to handle several hundred thousand concurrent players for the online game Crucible at Amazon Games Studios.
* Built the back end of a new customer facing image generation microservice for Amazon Web Services. Made with Java, Spring, AWT, Git, JUnit, PDF, and SVG.
* Part of a small squad that designed and implemented a feature in Java and Kotlin which tailors the Expedia hotel search experience to users individually, boosting conversions by more than 15% in under 12 weeks - the highest of any recorded squad at the time.
* Assisted Expedia in migration of a core HTTP routing service in 6 weeks with no customer impact, reducing licensing fees by nearly $500k annually.

### Founder / Developer - Vex Software Corporation (2010 - 2019)

* Developed and ran a website built with Ruby on Rails that previously served more than one million unique users per month.
* Built high performance backends using non-blocking I/O with the Netty framework in Java.

### Software Engineer - Marketly LLC (2015 - 2017)

* Cooperatively designed, developed, and operated a distributed ETL stack built in C# backed by Redis and MySQL on colocated hardware; which scrapes data from webpages and APIs, utilizes a custom machine learning model built with Python, Flask, and scikit-learn to classify websites, and feeds information into a Neo4J graph database to identify high-value targets for copyright litigation.
* Used Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and Bootstrap to develop client-facing web portals and APIs. Designed and developed a scalable RESTful API with Ruby, Sinatra, PhantomJS, and AWS S3 to capture any website to PDF or PNG.
