For nearly two years now, I have been working on my side project and startup, [AiSilicon](https://aisilicon.com), which is a platform-as-a-service that makes GPU compute easy to use and affordable. I'm proud to announce that it has finally launched!

The development of AiSilicon was a pretty long journey that involved:

* Building, configuring, and racking production grade GPU servers
* Colocation in a datacenter far from home, setting up networking, redundancies, etc.
* An entire PaaS backend written in Spring
* An entire PaaS frontend written in Spring
* Lots and lots of Kubernetes shenanigans
* GPU containerization/passthrough
* Hosting of git (and git-lfs) repositories
* Integration with Stripe for billing
* Networked file systems
* So much more that I can't think of...

No wonder it took almost two years! But the work is just beginning, and now it's time for myself and my business partner to climb the mountain of sales and marketing, to get this out to the world and help people build cool things.
