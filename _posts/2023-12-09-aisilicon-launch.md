For nearly two years now, I have been working pretty hard to build my side-project and startup, [AiSilicon](https://aisilicon.com), which is a platform-as-a-service that makes GPU compute easy to use and affordable. I'm proud to announce that it has finally launched!

The development of AiSilicon was a pretty long journey that involved:

* Building, configuring, and racking production grade GPU servers
* Colocation in a datacenter far from home, setting up networking, redundancies, etc.
* An entire PaaS backend written in Spring
* An entire PaaS frontend written in Spring
* Lots and lots of Kubernetes shenanigans
* GPU containerization/passthrough
* Hosting of git (and git-lfs) repositories
* Integration with Stripe for billing
* Networked file systems
* So much more that is now just a blur...

Considering I've also been working full-time at Nacelle... no wonder it took almost two years. But the work is honestly just beginning, because now it's time for myself and my business partner to climb the mountain of sales and marketing. Time to get the word out, iterate with user feedback, and help people build cool things!
