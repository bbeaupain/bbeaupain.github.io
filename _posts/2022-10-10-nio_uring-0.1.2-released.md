I think io_uring is really cool, so I built JNI bindings to port it to the Java programming language. I called this project [nio_uring](https://github.com/bbeaupain/nio_uring) as an ode to Java's original high performance I/O libraries, _nio_.

Features of the nio_uring project include:

* A simple and flexible API
* Unparalleled scalability for network applications
* Zero-copy functionality
* Being slightly opinionated

This project enabled me to build [hella-http](https://github.com/bbeaupain/hella-http), the fastest Java web-server this side of the Mississippi. Actually... I benchmarked it against all of the fastest Java HTTP libraries I could find, and hella-http beats all of them pretty handedly.

![Requests per Second]({{ '/assets/img/requests.png' | relative_url }}){: .mx-auto.d-block width="100%"}

X: concurrent connections. Y: requests per second
{: .mx-auto.d-block}

![Latency]({{ '/assets/img/requests.png' | relative_url }}){: .mx-auto.d-block width="100%"}

X: concurrent connections. Y: latency in microseconds
{: .mx-auto.d-block }

The above benchmarks were conducted between two EC2 c5.2xlarge instances, which have 8 virtual CPUs and 16GB of RAM. The library used to conduct and measure the benchmarks was `wrk`.

Kudos to the io_uring developers - this performance delta is more their accomplishment than mine. The io_uring syscall interface is particularly scalable because it was designed to be from the getgo, and it allows calling code to batch any number of I/O operations into a single syscall.

Version 0.1.2 is now available in the Maven central repository, which includes small bug fixes and performance improvements. The library is pretty well tested now, and I think I will work toward releasing a version 1.0.0 soon.

Until next time, have fun and build cool things!
